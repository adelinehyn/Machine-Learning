# Machine-Learning
# Sales and Advertising Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model to predict Advertising costs based on Sales data.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [econometrics.com](https://www.econometrics.com/intro/sales.htm).

## Files

- `SALES.txt`: The dataset file containing Sales and Advertising data.
- `prediction_script.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete code for data loading, processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results.png`: Screenshot of the output and plots generated.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the results.

## Results

- RMSE: 13.42
- R2 Score: 0.71

## Predictions

- Predicted Advertising Cost for 50 Sales: $69.10 million
- Predicted Advertising Cost for 100 Sales: $149.35 million
- Predicted Advertising Cost for 150 Sales: $229.60 million
